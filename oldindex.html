				<h2> About Me </h2>
				<hr>
				<p> I am an undergraduate studying computer scicence at Stanford University. Life is a gift,
					and I have to appreciate the fact that I get to open it each and every day. I grew up in rural
					South Louisiana where we aren't known <i>at all</i> for our standard of education, but I made do
					with what I did have. Futhermore, I want AllStarCode to know my story. I could go on and on in an
					attempt to tell my story, but I feel as though my story is well represented <a href="javascript:videopopup()">here</a>.
